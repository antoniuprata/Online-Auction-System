  <h1 style="font-size:50px">How an auction works:</h1>
  <p>Once an item is placed for sale, the auctioneer will start at a relatively low price to attract a large number of bidders. </p>
  <p>The price increases each time someone makes a new, higher bid until finally, </p>
  <p>no other bidders are willing to offer more than the most recent bid, and the highest bidder takes the item.</p>
